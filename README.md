## 🚀 What I'm About

I believe in writing **clean, efficient code** that solves meaningful problems. I'm particularly interested in:
- **Systems Programming** – File management, compression, multithreading
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** – Optimizing for performance and correctness
- **Full-Stack Development** – Building complete applications from backend to UI
- **Security & Access Control** – Understanding RBAC and permission systems
- **Compiler Design & Language Concepts** – How programs are parsed and executed
